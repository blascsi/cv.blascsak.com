I started as a UI Engineer. After going through bootcamp I expanded my horizons and now I'm working with each technology I can get my hands on, though my main focus is still Web Applications. </p> <p> I'm working with my team on making Live Broadcasting better for Meta products. I'm building features in one of the company's web applications that make live broadcasts more reliable, with better engagement tools, and more importantly, easier to use while still serving our power users too. </p> </li> <li> <h2 class="experience-list__list-header"> Biot.ai Lab | <small>2019 - 2021</small> </h2> <p> From 2019 I was working with a startup which is trying to make the world a better place through biotechnological projects. </p> <p> I am responsible for developing new features in an existing Angular application, with a huge emphasis on the front-end logic and the user experience. </p> <p> I also try to make our code-base better by integrating useful new tools into our pipeline. </p> </li> <li> <h2 class="experience-list__list-header"> Udacity Scholarship | <small>2017 - 2018</small> </h2> <p> In 2017 I was awarded by a scholarship from Google, where we learned how to develop web applications that work well with mobile devices. </p> </li> <li> <h2 class="experience-list__list-header"> EPAM Systems | <small>2016 - 2018</small> </h2> <p> At EPAM I was part of a team of developers working on an enterprise scale Angular.js (and later Angular) project. </p> <p> I was mainly responsible for developing new features, which included prototyping and creating Proof of Concepts inside the application. </p> <p> I was also present when the team migrated from Angular.js to Angular, and even took a few looks on the deployment pipeline there. </p> <p> Last but not least for 2 years I was giving an Introduction to Javascript class to University students while working there. </p> </li> </ol> </section> <section>  <h1 class="section-header">Technologies</h1> <ul class="technologies__list"> <li> GIT <span class="icon-git text--purple" aria-hidden="true"></span> </li> <li> HTML5 <span class="icon-html5 text--purple" aria-hidden="true"></span> </li> <li> CSS <span class="icon-css3 text--purple" aria-hidden="true"></span> </li> <li> Javascript (ES5/ES6) <span class="icon-javascript text--purple" aria-hidden="true"></span> </li> <li> Typescript <span class="icon-typescript text--purple" aria-hidden="true"></span> </li> </ul> <ul class="technologies__list"> <li> React <span class="icon-react text--purple" aria-hidden="true"></span> </li> <li> Jest <span class="icon-jest text--purple" aria-hidden="true"></span> </li> </ul> <input id="show-more" type="checkbox" class="toggle"> <div class="toggle-controls"> <label for="show-more" class="link toggle-off"> More ▼ </label> <label for="show-more" class="link toggle-on"> Less ▲ </label> <div class="toggle__container"> <p class="technologies__more-intro-paragraph"> These are technologies that I tried but not used in production yet, or things that I used and love, but have not deemed important enough for the list above. </p> <p> Gatsby, NodeJS, Express, Continous Integration/Deployment, GitHub, GitLab, Prettier. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section id="contact-me">  <h1 class="section-header">Contact Me</h1> <div class="contact-me"> <a href="mailto:attila@blascsak.com"> <span class="icon-gmail text--blue" aria-label="email"></span> </a> <a href="https://github.com/blascsi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <span class="icon-github text--blue" aria-label="github"></span> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/attila-blascs%C3%A1k-245131124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <span class="icon-linkedin text--blue" aria-label="linkedin"></span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/blascsi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <span class="icon-twitter text--blue" aria-label="twitter"></span> </a> </div> </section> </main> <script type="module" src="/index.d171c060.js" defer></script><script src="/index.a6e02eb5.js" defer nomodule></script> </body></html>
