            <p>
              Currently I'm working in a team responsible for improving code
              quality at scale. We own infrastructure for static code analysis,
              and provide metrics that engineers use to understand the health of
              their code, and to empower them to take action in improving it's
              quality. The team is very data driven, and my work includes
              creating developer tools and dashboards, data pipelines, and
              executing projects based on the data we see and the needs of other
              developers a the company.

              Meta - Game Developer | <small>2024</small>
            </h2>
            <p>
              In 2024 I worked in a team of game engine developers, implementing
              new features in one of our applications running in the Meta Quest
              headsets. I've worked on implementing video playback in 3D, and
              solving reliability issues with video streaming. I was also
              involved in exploring video related technoligies that we depended
              on during video playback.

            <p>
              I worked with my team on making Live Broadcasting better for Meta
              products. I'm building features in one of the company's web
              applications that make live broadcasts more reliable, with better
              engagement tools, and more importantly, easier to use while still
              serving our power users too.
            </p>
            <p>
              My role in the team started out heavily focused on UI and
              front-end focused, but with time I grew into a generalist. From
              implementing new UI solutions, and working with design on making
              sure we provide the best user experience, I expanded my horizons
              to implementing complex back-end frameworks for data safety, and
              writing infrastructure code that my team required to make our
              services more reliable.

            <p>
              From 2019 I was working with a startup which is trying to make the
              world a better place through biotechnological projects.

              I am responsible for developing new features in an existing
              Angular application, with a huge emphasis on the front-end logic
              and the user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also try to make our code-base better by integrating useful new
              tools into our pipeline.

            <p>
              At EPAM I was part of a team of developers working on an
              enterprise scale Angular.js (and later Angular) project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was mainly responsible for developing new features, which
              included prototyping and creating Proof of Concepts inside the
              application.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was also present when the team migrated from Angular.js to
              Angular, and even took a few looks on the deployment pipeline
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last but not least for 2 years I was giving an Introduction to
              Javascript class to University students while working there.
